            <h2>About Trans I.D.</h2>
            <p>The Trans I.D. guide is an app for individuals going through the process of changing their name and/or gender marker with the governmental bodies of Canada, and it is intended for use by any and all individuals, be they Trans, Two-Spirit, non-binary, gender diverse, or otherwise in need.</p>
            <blockquote>Each and every one of us deserves to have our documents properly represent our identity and personhood.</blockquote>
            <p>This service is designed with the belief that there is no average experience for anyone who may seek these changes, and the understanding that navigating governmental bureaucracy can be incredibly daunting and inaccessible. It is developed and maintained by <a href="https://danateagle.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Dana Teagle</a>, a non-binary trans woman and web developer, who previously offered this service through one-on-one consultations. <a href="mailto:dana.r.teagle@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Get in touch</a> to book Dana for a Trans I.D. workshop.</p>
