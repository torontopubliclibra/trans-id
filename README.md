# Trans I.D.

## About

[Trans I.D.](https://trans-id.app/) is a React app currently in development by [Dana Teagle](https://danateagle.com). This site is written using the Javascript library React with SASS for style.

It is a guide for individuals going through the process of changing their name and/or gender marker with governmental bodies in Canada. Every one of us deserves to have our documents accurately reflect our identities but the process of updating your information can be confusing and inaccessible.

This site uses controlled inputs and state management to create a user-friendly resource that tailors itself to each person's context and experience.

It will launch in late 2022 for use in Ontario, with plans to expand to other provinces in 2023.
